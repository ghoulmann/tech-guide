At Chelsea School, many students are introduced to Kurzweil_ 3000 as powerful tool for composition, editing, and revision.

Kurzweil_ 3000 was pioneering in the areas of text to speech (**TTS**) and optical character recognition.

According to Kurzweil's promotional copy: Using natural sounding voices, Kurzweil_ 3000 reads text aloud to students, allowing them to follow along as the text is highlighted and spoken at a self-adjusted pace. Additional literacy tools use a multisensory approach to engage students as they develop language fluency, comprehension and retention. As a result, students with language-based learning differences are able to read at a higher level than they could independently and achieve success alongside their peers.

Some students' IEPs provide for TTS accomodations during state testing. That accomodation is provided through Kurzweil_ 3000 -- but only when the student is familiar with the software.
